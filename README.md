# Journy: an app for collaborative journaling
Welcome to Journy. To use our app, clone our repository and run 

    npm install
    npm start

You will see a QR code in your terminal. To scan the QR code, make sure you have the expo app installed on your [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/expo-go/id982107779) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US&gl=US). Then, scan the QR code on your camera and the app should load. 

We were able to implement all of the major functionality from our [medium fi prototype](https://www.figma.com/proto/cNzjrFOVY0VeSttXtoQAB5/JOURNY?node-id=871%3A471&scaling=scale-down&page-id=871%3A236&starting-point-node-id=871%3A471). There are a few minor features that don't work yet:

    1. images are stored locally and not on the server, so a person can only view images they posted on their device and won't see other users images
    2. recording audio is not implemented

Thank you for viewing our app!
